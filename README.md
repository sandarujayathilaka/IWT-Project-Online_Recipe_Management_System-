registered user, he/she should click on the register button and fill out the registration form with his 
username and password. The logged user (registered user) can manage (add, delete, update) their 
recipes, and make an appointment with a nutritionist by using the user dashboard. As well Users 
can give feedback on the available recipes in the system. Register users can also read the available 
recipes and search the recipes with food categories. FOODOVEN has an admin panel to manage 
the system. Five main fields can handle by administrators in the system. Such as Recipe 
Management, Nutritionist Management, Contact Management, Category Management, and User
